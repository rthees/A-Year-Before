"A Year Before" shows a list of articles, which were written a certain time ago. So you can show in a history, what happend in your blog in the past

== Description ==

With "A Year Before" you can show the titles of the articles which were written a certain time ago. So you can show in a "historical corner", what happend in your blog e.g. 30 days, 6 months or a year before. You can use it as a wordpress-widget or put it in your theme as a php-function with parameters.

== Installation ==

= Using widgets in wordpress =

1. Download the plugin and put the directory "a-year-before" in the plugin-folder of your wordpress-installation.
2. Then activate the plugin.
3. Go "Themes/Widgets" and pull the widget in the sidebar. Ready to go! Configure it, if you want.

=  Not using widgets in wordpress =

1. Download the plugin and put the file ayb_posts.php in the plugin-folder of your  Wordpress-installation.
2. Then activate the plugin.
3. In your template - e.g. the sidebar - you can insert the following PHP-code:

		<?php if (function_exists("ayb_posts")) { ?>
		<div class="einjahr">
		<h2>Vor einem Jahr</h2>
		  <ul>
			 <?php ayb_posts(); ?>
		  </ul>
		</div>
		<?php } ?>

== Configuration ==

= Using the widget =

Just click on the configuration-button of the widget an use the selfexplaining popup-dialog.
Use the output-pattern to define the look of the found articles. Possible patterns are:

* %title% The title of the article
* %link% The link to the article
* %date% The date of the article
* %excerpt% The excerpt of the article. You can define the number of displayed characters bei appending the number like %excerpt80%, which will display 80 characters.

= Not using the widget =

You can pass some parameters in this scheme
parameter1=value1&parameter2=value2&parameter3=value3 ...

You can use the following parameters

* day : the number of days ago you want to show the articles.
* month : the number of month ago you want to show the articles.
* year : the number of years ago you want to show the articles.
* before : piece of HTML to insert before the title of the articles. Default `<li>`
* after: piece of HTML to insert after the title of the articles. Default `</li>`
* range: number of days the plugin will search back in the future (relative to the values of day, month and year above) for an article. Meant as a "round about this day"-feature. Default 0
* showdate: shows the date (showdate=1) before every title or not (showdate=0)
* dateformat : dateformat as used by PHP. Default ist the german shortform "d.m.y"
* notfound: the text the plugin will output, if no article is found on the defined date.
* anniversary: if set to 1, the plugin will display all articles ever blogged with the same number of day and month. The parameters "day", "month", "year" and "range" will be ignored if used.

= Examples =

`ayb_posts("day=30&before=&after=<br />&showdate=0");`
Shows the titles of the articles written 30 days ago without showing the date. The articles will not been showed as a HTML-list but simply seperated by a linebreak `<br />`.

`ayb_posts("month=6&day=14&notfound=Nothing blogged on this day.");`
The titles of the articles written half a year and two weeks before, also showing the date . If there was no article written on that day, the output will be »Nothing blogged on this day.«

`ayb_posts("range=14&dateformat=y-m-d");`
Looks up a year back for written articles. If none are found, the plugin will check the next 14 days in the future. If a article is found on some of this days, all articles of this day will be listed with a "year-month-day"-format.

`ayb_posts("anniversary=1");`
Shows the title of all posts, which were posted on the same day in the same month, independend of the year. E.g. on chistmas day you will see all posts, which are posted on december 24th since the blog was started.

== Styling ==

If you like CSS, you can style the date with the class `ayb_date`, the link of the article with the class `ayb_link` and the notfound-message by using the class `ayb_notfound`.

== Uninstall ==
Before Wordpress 2.6.1: Delete the a-year-before-folder from the wordpress-plugin-folder.

Since Wordpress 2.7: Deactivate the plugin, then select "delete" in the plugin-panel. The files *and* the options of this plugin will be deleted. Thank you for using "a year before". ;-)
